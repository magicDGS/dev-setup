# dev-setup

This repo is meant to contain my scripts, dotfiles and configuration for my personal development environment.
Also the documentation to setup the environments is provided as a static site.

## Goal

The **main goal** of this project is to keep a **personal backup for my configuration pipeline** to be able to reproduce it in the future.
Nevertheless, the scope of this repo also includes:

- Documentt he way to perform the configuration and problems that might happen during it
- Have a backup of the toolstack and configuration that I did on my systems
- Improve over time and have a historized way to recover some setup
- Share with the community for inspiration
