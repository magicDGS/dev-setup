Somehow the `winget` installation of `miniconda` have stop working.
That's the reason of using the installation guide.
:::

Install `miniconda` for python management following the [Miniconda Installation Guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/) with the following options:

- Just for me
- Default path
- Disable create shortcuts
- Enable Add to PATH, register as the default installation for python and clear the package cache
