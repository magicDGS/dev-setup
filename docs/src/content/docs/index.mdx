## Goals

The *main* goal of this project is to keep a *personal backup for my configuration* pipeline
to be able to reproduce it in the future. Nevertheless, the scope of this repo also includes:

* Document he way to perform the configuration and problems that might happen during it
* Have a backup of the toolstack and configuration that I did on my systems
* Improve over time and have a historized way to recover some setup
* Share with the community for inspiration
